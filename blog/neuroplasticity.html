                            Ever considered studying another language? Maybe you thought a second (or third) language might boost your career opportunities, or you wanted to pick it up just for fun.
                            <br /> In either case, you’d be doing your brain a big favour. There’s plenty of evidence to suggest that acquiring a new language improves cognitive function.
                            <br />In one 2012 study, researchers looked at 10 exchange students who were native English speakers studying German in Switzerland. After 5 months of intensive language study, their proficiency in German had increased — and
                            so had the density of gray matter in their brain.
                            <br />After 3 months of intensive study of a new topic, 14 adult interpreters saw increases in both gray matter density and hippocampal volume. The hippocampus plays an important role in long-term memory recall. If you enjoy
                            travel, here’s one more reason to get out and explore somewhere new: Travel may help enhance cognitive flexibility, inspire you, and enhance creativity.
                            <br /> Experiencing new scenery and surroundings can also help you learn about different cultures and become a better communicator, both of which can have additional cognitive benefits.
                            <br /> Visiting new places can also help broaden your general worldview, which can help open your mind and give you a new perspective on things closer to home, like career goals, friendships, or personal values. If you can’t
                            get out into the wider world right now, don’t worry. You can still take yourself on a trip closer to home.
