                            Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges, and defuse conflict
                            in a situation.

                            IQ stands for intelligence quotient. IQ tests are tools to measure intellectual abilities and potential. They're designed to reflect a wide range of cognitive skills, such as reasoning, logic, and problem-solving. It's a test of intelligence, something
                            you're largely born with.

                            IQ measure your ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp or communicate complex ideas. EQ measure your ability to recognize emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to guide your decisions. Both kinds of intelligence can influence
                            your job performance, relationships, and overall well-being. Understanding and developing both kinds of intelligence may be the key to success in many areas of our lives.

                            Emotional intelligence can lead us on the path to a fulfilled and happy life by providing a framework through which to apply standards of intelligence to emotional responses and understand that these responses may be logically consistent or inconsistent
