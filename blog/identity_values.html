                    Describe your core personal values?
                    <div>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Stay Consistent even if you move slow. This is very important to me. I am big believer in this. I was never like this but I learn that this is one of the most important traits you can have if you want to beat your competition
                                or get ahead in life.
                            </li>
                            <li> Be Present reduce reminiscing and too much planning. I have this tendency to reminisce my past times or look too ahead to the future. I fail to live in the present. I have actually realized this since 2 years back and learning
                                to be more present in my life. Sometime this includes the boring stuff but being present in them. It is harder than we think.

                            </li> Take Criticism objectivity and not subjectively. Coming from a where religion and culture was important. I used to find myself being disappointed in myself when I am criticized. I also realize that criticism is important
                            to be able to self-correct. Taking criticism objectively and not subjectively is a good thing. Because I am able to filter what is important and what is personal and what is important in order to improve.

                            <li> Being brave. I used to struggle in this. I have had and still fear many things. Fear of failure. I have learnt to be brave. Playing offense when needed to. Not being passive.

                            </li>

                            <li> Be kind. You never know when someone needs it. I used to struggle with this. I am learning everyday to be kind. Working on my empathy skill. It does take a higher level of intelligence.

                            </li>
                            <li> Choose truth over happiness. Again, this is something I value. Personally, responsibility is a massive shift change in my life. Very under rated. Also, I have been reading and following a lot of Jordan Peterson lately. He talks
                                about this. Really resonated with me.

                    Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took?
                    <div>
                        <p> I was once working with a business partner when I discovered he wanted to get a loan with the bank in a fraudulent manner. He was also a good friend. At the time we wanted to start a business ended up staring it and ran into a
                            few roadblocks. I was quite naive. Initially I helped him but felt very uneasy. There were quite a few days. I questioned myself during this process and going through with the scheme. I was also fearful of being the fall guy.
                            I summed up the courage after talking to my dad and then eventually cut ties with him. I didn’t report it. I couldn’t I just let him be. Looking back, I should have reported it. It was a good learning experience. Some people
                            are willing to break ethics to get ahead. I learnt the hard way. Had to remove myself from business I help create with him. I am glad I did. Doing the right thing eventually pays off. Trust me it does.

                    Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity?
                    <div>

                        <p> My dad has always instilled certain values in me like hard work, being responsibly. Taking responsibly for yourself. I am a 1st generation immigrant to this country. My dad migrated with me my mum and sister when I was 8 years
                            old from a country in war and hostile civil fractions. He was disabled but able to look after me my sister and my mum. Give us a good life. For a dude who is crippled that is amazing. Always look up to him for courage and strength.
