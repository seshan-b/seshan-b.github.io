                            My long-term goal is to really master the field of software development. 
                            To be able to create and solve problems with this skill-set. Also I have a few project I want to launch. Hopefully get it off the ground. Finger crossed.

                        I can sometimes get caught into a never-ending learning cycle. I have some OCD tendencies. 
                        I am a bit of a perfectionist. I feel this is a weakness. Because it hinders me from getting things done.  
                        I am much better at deal with it now than I used to be.

                    What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
                    <div>
                    <p>
                        I want to be able to work with groups of people. To be able to horne by leadership skills. Again, this is not easy. 
                        I have to learn this properly. I have managed teams in the past but I can be to mission focused without thinking about the team.

                    <p>
                        When this happens, I must take a break clear my head. Take a walk take my mind off the current situation and then come back to it. 
                        Again, there is more to learn on this for me.

                        I want honest feedback. I want to know if I am progressing or falling behind. How I can do better.

                    Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. 
                    It’s important to plan these in?

                        At the moment I am taking care of my dad. Help him out. 
                        Also, I have other client projects that I do on the side apart from my main income as a video editor. 
                        Since starting with Dev Academy I have taken a step back from these client projects so I can give my full attention to the study at Dev Academy.
