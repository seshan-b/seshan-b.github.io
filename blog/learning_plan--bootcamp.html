                <h3> I am very committed to learning software development. I have been self-teaching for 6 years. Always wanted to do Dev Academy since 2016. I now have the opportunity to do it. I am ready for bootcamp and hopefully looking to master the craft

                        <p>
                            I want to be able to master software development. At least be able to master 1 programming language. I want to be able to have a deeper understanding of the concepts. Once I finish Dev Academy, I really want to get involved in project work. Possibly help
                            infant startups. Do some sort of contracting work for clients.
                            <br /> I want my work to be an example of the high standards. Not planned on leaving the country yet but who know if opportunity provides, I will seek opportunities overseas.

                        <p>
                            My biggest strength is researching the hell out of something. Grasping concepts over knowledge. My weakness is time management. I found my other weakness is not asking for help early on. Trying to solve a JavaScript problem as some point I should just
                            reach other and ask for help.

                    What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Writing up these core material answers. Solving JavaScript code challenges. Negative messages when I am not able to solve coding challenges. Getting tired in the afternoon. Reading the code challenges and trying to implement it. Time management. Asking
                            for help. Staying within the timeboxes for the material.
                            <br>/ I would like to improve more on these things. Be able to over come this in my 9 weeks.

                    What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Reach out to for help if I do get stuck in the JavaScript coding challenges. I feel I take too long to reach other. Need to reach out sooner and also keep to the time boxes time management is one of my biggest weaknesses I really need to work on.

                        <p>
                            I want honest feedback. I want to know if I am progressing or falling behind. How I can do better. Also, more explanation on the concepts of programming. I still feel I am not able to fully grasp the concepts. Helpful resources I am not much of a reader
                            so anything in visual media that will help me grasp the concepts.

                            I really want to master JavaScript or at least to a point where I can start writing application by myself without having to see other peopleâ€™s code. I want to also be able to master the concepts of programming so I can pick up other programing languages
                            like Python or C#.
